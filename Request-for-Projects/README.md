# Project Ideas - Request for Projects on Gnosis Chain

**[1] Improving payroll with an EVM programmable bank account**

**Project Description:** This project provides an opportunity to brainstorm solutions to enhance the payroll process using an EVM programmable bank account. This topic lets you start the project by exploring various ideas that can help improve the payroll process. For example, creating a smart contract that validates each employee's working hours and calculates their salary accordingly or developing a smart contract that automatically deducts taxes, social security, and other necessary expenses from their income.

**[3] Open source solutions supporting zkBridge**

**Project Description:** A new approach is put forth by zkBridge for building trustless, extensible, permissionless, universal, and efficient cross-chain bridges using ZKP. This topic allows you to submit your ideas for creating end-to-end zkBridge solutions across the Gnosis Chain as a public benefit and fostering an open ecosystem for creating a safe, effective, and all-encompassing foundation for multichain interoperability.

**[4] An EVM Header Oracle Aggregator**

**Project Description:** Hashi is an EVM Header Oracle Aggregator, designed to facilitate a principled approach to cross-chain bridge security. The primary insight is that the vast majority of bridge-related security incidents could have had a minimal impact if the systems relying on them had built in some redundancy. In other words, it's much more secure to require messages to be validated by multiple independent mechanisms, rather than by just one. This topic allows you to propose your ideas to build on top of an EVM Header Oracle Aggregator.

**What you can build with Hashi**
  * Write an adapter for another bridge:, preferably a ZK light client one: SuccintLabs, Dendreth, ZKCollective
  * Write a contract that checks merkle proof of some event/ storage slot
  * Alternate implementations of GiriGiriBashi: Aggregation/ Governance rules in case oracles disagree
  * Build an end-to-end application on top of Hashi (Token bridge, NFT bridge, Governance bridge, etc)

**[5] Euro Ramp App - Create a Safe app powered by Monerium**

**Project Description:** The Euro Ramp app is a concept for a mobile application that would enable users to purchase, sell, and keep various currencies securely and easily using Monerium, a platform for decentralized payments built on the blockchain. The application would offer a safe and straightforward interface for instantly converting fiat money into digital assets. The Euro Ramp app would be a great tool for anyone interested in investing in Euros or other currencies in a Safe app.

**[6] Connecting Worlds with Li-Fi - Aggregate the best Euro price to Gnosis Chain**

**Project Description:** The concept of "Connecting Worlds with Li-Fi" refers to the potential use of Li-Fi technology to build a global network that connects people and devices across the world. Li-Fi is a quick and dependable technology that can send data between devices even when they are far apart, making it ideal for this kind of communication. The idea of aggregating the best Euro price to the Gnosis Chain in particular involves utilizing blockchain technology to make it possible to exchange Euros securely and decentralized at the best market prices across various nations or areas.
